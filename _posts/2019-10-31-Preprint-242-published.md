  I published a new preprint to the CoMo website: 
  <a href="https://como.ceb.cam.ac.uk/preprints/242/">
    Study of industrial titania synthesis using a hybrid particle-number and detailed particle model.
  </a>
  It presents a modelling study for an industrial titania reactor, using my recently developed hybrid model 
  to enable more complete particle and system descriptions. Particle morphology is characterised extensively for 
  different process and design choices, providing insight into the sensitivity of particle formation and growth dynamics 
  under industrially relevant conditions.
