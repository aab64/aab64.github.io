  <strong>Investigating the Composition of the Metal Dimer Site in Chabazite for Direct Methane-to-Methanol Conversion</strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>  
In this paper, we study the complete reaction cycle for methane-to-methanol conversion over various transition-metal dimers 
  in the chabazite zeolite using density functional theory calculations and first-principles-informed microkinetic modelling, 
  building on our previous reaction mechanism for the Cu<sub>2</sub> dimer under dry and wet (with an additional H<sub>2</sub>O molecule) conditions. 
  Using the adsorption energy of atomic oxygen as the descriptor, we establish scaling relations for the energy landscapes and generate the volcano plot for reaction rate. 
  Both the first-principles-informed microkinetic model and the volcano plot indicate good activity for the Cu<sub>2</sub>, AuPd, and PdCu systems under technologically relevant conditions.
