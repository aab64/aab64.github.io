  <strong>Light-Off in Plasmon-Mediated Photocatalysis</strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>  
  In this paper, we study photothermal rate enhancement in plasmon-mediated photocatalysis 
  using the example of CO oxidation over nanofabricated neat Pd and Au50Pd50 alloy catalysts. 
  We find that rate enhancement differs by orders of magnitude depending on the position of 
  catalyst operation along the light-off curve measured in the dark, indicating that small 
  fluctuations in reactor temperature or temperature gradients across a sample may have a 
  significant impact on the global and local photothermal rate enhancement. 
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We use first-principles informed microkinetic modelling to qualitatively rationalize the 
  distinct conversion profiles observed for the two catalyst materials in terms of the 
  influence of the underlying energetics on the kinetics.
