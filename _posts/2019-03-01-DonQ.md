  Ballet has been a lifelong hobby of mine - 
  while at school I danced with the KZN Youth Ballet and, as an adult, 
  I have had the opportunity to attend classes in Johannesburg, Stockholm, Berlin, Singapore and Cambridge! This weekend I 
  performed in the <a href="http://www.cambridgeballetclub.co.uk/">Cambridge Univeristy Ballet Club</a> 
  performance of Don Quixote (that's me in the purple on the front left, photo credit: Alex Lake) which was incredibly fun.
