I presented my work on a hybrid particle-number and detailed particle model to improve robustness and efficiency of Monte Carlo simulation for high-rate particle synthesis at the Combustion Aerosol Conference (CAC) here in Cambridge. The Combustion Aerosol Conference is a three-day conference co-held with the Cambridge Particle Meeting.
