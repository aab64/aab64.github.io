This week, I participated in the DPG (Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft / German Physical Society) virtual Surface Science meeting, where I presented a <a href="/images/poster.pdf">poster</a> about kinetic models for ethanol conversion to 1,3-butadiene on MgO. I was impressed with the conference platform, which provided a nice approximation to a poster hall (given the circumstances), and a clear scheduling tool for checking what was on and planning what talks to "attend". 
<br/>
<br/>
I summarised this work in an <a href="https://aab64.github.io/blog/2020/10/21/Butadiene-preprint-published">earlier post</a> and 
the paper can be found on <a href="https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.13118420.v2">ChemRxiv</a>.
