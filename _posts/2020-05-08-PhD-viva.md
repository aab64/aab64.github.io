    Because of the COVID-19 situation, I was unable to defend my PhD in person in Cambridge. 
    Instead, we organized a four-way videoconference, including myself, my internal and external examiners, and the independent chair. 
    Luckily, there were no technical difficulties and the experience was a positive one. 
    I am very happy to have completed this examination and so grateful to everyone who advised, assisted and supported me along the way!
