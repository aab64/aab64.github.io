    Because of the COVID-19 situation, I was unable to defend my PhD in person in Cambridge. 
    Instead, we organized a four-way videoconference, including myself, my internal and external examiners, and the independent chair. 
    Luckily, there were no technical difficulties and the experience was a positive one. 
    I am excited to have completed this examination and so grateful to everyone who assisted and supported me along the way &ndash special thanks to Prof Markus Kraft for supervising me, Dr Jethro Akroyd for advising me, the CoMo group for all the teatimes, my family and my partner JP (who also bought me my PhD mug below)!
