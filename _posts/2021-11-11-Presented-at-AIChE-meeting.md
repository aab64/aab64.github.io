 Today, I presented work from my Chalmers postdoc at the annual AIChE 
 (American Institute of Chemical Engineers) conference in Boston, USA. 
  I have two talks at the conference, the first discussing multiscale modelling 
  of CO oxidation on Cu and Pd/PdAu nanoparticles to support operando studies, 
  and the other related to my work on first-principles based 
  modelling of the catalytic conversion of ethanol to 1,3-butadiene. 
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was nice to attend a conference in person again this week and 
  I am also looking forward to next week's virtual component, 
  at which I am presenting talk number two!
