 My paper, 
 <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2019.03.033">
  A hybrid particle-number and particle model for efficient solution of population balance equations
 </a>
 has just been accepted for publication by the Journal of Computational Physics. In this work, we present an algorithm to resolve broad particle size distributions more efficiently within the framework of our detailed population balance solver, using a hybrid treatment of the particle type space (see figure below). The <a href="https://como.ceb.cam.ac.uk/preprints/211/">preprint</a> is available on my group's website.
