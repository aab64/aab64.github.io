 My paper has just been accepted for publication by the Journal of Computational Physics. The preprint is published on my group's website: 
 <a href="http://como.ceb.cam.ac.uk/index.php?Page=Preprints&No=211">
  A hybrid particle-number and particle model for efficient solution of population balance equations.
 </a>
 It presents an algorithm to resolve broad particle size distributions more efficiently within the framework of our detailed population balance solver.
