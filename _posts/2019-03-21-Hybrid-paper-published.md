 My paper has been accepted for publication at Journal of Computational Physics. The preprint is published on my group's website: 
  <a href="http://como.ceb.cam.ac.uk/index.php?Page=Preprints&No=211">
    A hybrid particle-number and particle model for efficient solution of population balance equations
   </a>. 
  It presents an algorithm to resolve broad particle size distributions more efficiently within the framework of our detailed population balance solver.
