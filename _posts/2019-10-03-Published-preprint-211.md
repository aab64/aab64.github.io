  <p>
    I published a new preprint to the CoMo website: 
    <a href="http://como.ceb.cam.ac.uk/index.php?Page=Preprints&No=211">A hybrid particle-number and particle model for efficient solution of population balance equations</a>. 
    It presents an algorithm to resolve broad particle size distributions more efficiently 
    within the framework of our detailed population balance solver.
