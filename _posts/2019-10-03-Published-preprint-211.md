  I published a new preprint to the CoMo website: 
  <a href="https://como.ceb.cam.ac.uk/preprints/211/">
    A hybrid particle-number and particle model for efficient solution of population balance equations.
  </a>
  It presents an algorithm to resolve broad particle size distributions more efficiently within the framework of our detailed population balance solver.
