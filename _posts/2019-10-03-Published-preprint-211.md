<p>
	I published a new preprint to the CoMo website: 
 	<a href="http://como.ceb.cam.ac.uk/index.php?Page=Preprints&No=211">
  		A hybrid particle-number and particle model for efficient solution of population balance equations
 	</a>. 
	It presents an algorithm to resolve broad particle size distributions more efficiently within the framework of our detailed population balance solver.
