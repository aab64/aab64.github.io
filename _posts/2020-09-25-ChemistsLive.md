I presented work from my postdoc at Chalmers University in a virtual talk at the American Chemical Society (ACS) Chemists Live event which was organised to supplement the fall meeting. 
<br/>
<br/>
I summarised this talk in an <a href="https://aab64.github.io/blog/2020/08/16/Virtual-ACS-talk">earlier post</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
The paper has now been published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18623-1">Nature Communications</a>.
