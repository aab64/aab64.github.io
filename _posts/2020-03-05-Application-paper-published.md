 My paper, 
 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009250920301470">
  Study of industrial titania synthesis using a hybrid particle-number and detailed particle model
 </a>
 has just been accepted for publication in Chemical Engineering Science. 
 In this work, we applied our recently proposed hybrid particle model for stochastic solution of population balance equations 
 to study the industrial synthesis of titania. The new model enables more efficient and robust simulation of particle growth 
 dynamics under industrially relevant conditions and can accommodate sophisticated tracking of particle characteristics that are 
 critical to end-product quality.
