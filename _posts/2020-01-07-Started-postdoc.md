  My husband and I loved our time in Sweden during our masters studies and were keen to return after our respective PhDs. 
  We recently moved to Göteborg, on Sweden's west coast (Sveriges västkust), and I have started a postdoc in <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/physics/research/chemicalphysics/Pages/default.aspx">Chemical Physics</a> at Chalmers University of Technology. 

  My project involves modelling chemical reaction kinetics and transport in nanoscale, heterogeneous catalysis. The goal is to develop understanding of catalyst behaviour and gas-phase flow dynamics, and to support experimental work on heterogeneous catalytic systems.
