  This weekend, I was able to return to Churchill College, Cambridge for a belated graduation celebration for my PhD. 
  Because of the pandemic, I defended my PhD virtually in 2020 and then graduated in absentia earlier this year. 
  It was so lovely to return to Churchill College for the weekend, to walk into town in my PhD gown and hood, 
  enter Senate House for the ceremony, and have lunch in the college dining hall afterwards! Guests are not allowed 
  to attend the ceremony at the moment to limit the number of people in the hall, 
  so it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbChq_IbpKI&ab_channel=HTempestGraduations/"><b>live-streamed</b></a> and 
  my family in South Africa were able to watch too!
