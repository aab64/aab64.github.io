  <strong>Wurster fluidised-bed coating: Coarse-graining technique within CFD-DEM in conjunction with heat and mass transfer</strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>  
  
</p>

This paper presents an exciting study applying a coupled computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and coarse-grained discrete element method (DEM) simulation to the fluidised bed coating process. 
It demonstrates that the coarse-grained simulations still achieve good accuracy compared to experiment and other simulations from literature, and 
highlights the real potential for coarse-graining to scale these simulation methods to industrially relevant systems for the first time.
