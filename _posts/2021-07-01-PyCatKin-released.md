  The Python Catalysis Kinetics (PyCatKin) toolset is an object-oriented Python package 
  to perform kinetics calculations including microkinetic modelling and energy span analysis.

  The core of the code is a set of modules in which states are loaded 
  (for example, using energies from first-principles calculations), 
  elementary reactions are defined (adsorption, Langmuir-Hinshelwood etc.), 
  boundary conditions/reactors are specified, and a system object is instantiated. 
  Then, the equations for the surface kinetics can be solved using an ODE or steady-state method. 
  There is also an energy module for drawing and assessing reaction energy landscapes 
  and considering rate determining states.

  I developed PyCatKin over the course of my postdoc at Chalmers and 
  used it to perform kinetics calculations in several publications, including:    
 - <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.1c01537">CO oxidation on nanoparticles</a>  
 - <a href="https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.13118420.v2">Ethanol conversion to 1,3-butadiene on MgO</a>  
 - <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c04062">Direct methane conversion to methanol in Cu-SSZ-13</a>.
