 I had the opportunity to present work from my Chalmers postdoc at the 27th North American Catalysis Society Meeting in New York, USA. The talk was about first-principles based 
  kinetic modelling using two approaches to investigate the MgO-catalysed conversion of ethanol to 1,3-butadiene. 
  It was a great week in New York City, meeting former colleagues, and listening to some interesting talks!
