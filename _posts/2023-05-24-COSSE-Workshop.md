It was great to return to KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm recently to attend the 2023 COSSE Workshop!  
<br/>
<br/>
I am an alumna of the <a href="https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/computer-simulations-for-science-and-engineering/msc-computer-simulations-for-science-and-engineering-1.44243">
COSSE</a> (Computer Simulations for Science and Engineering) master's programme and spent the first year of my double degree at KTH (and the second at TU Berlin). 
The programme provided a solid basis in the theory and application of numerical methods for solving engineering problems, enabling my further graduate studies and subsequent career in scientific modelling and simulation. 
<br/>
<br/>
The workshop provided an opportunity to reconnect with other alumni and my previous lecturers, as well as interact with the current cohort of students. 
I gave a talk about my current work in process modelling in pharmaceutical product development at AstraZeneca, and the day ended with a sunset boat cruise around the Stockholm archipelago.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the organizers for a very nice time in Stockholm!
