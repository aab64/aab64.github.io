  I was fortunate to spend two years of my PhD working at the Cambridge 
  <a href="https://www.cares.cam.ac.uk/"><b>CARES</b></a> office in Singapore. 
  This provided a great opportunity to experience a different academic environment, 
  working in a building with research centres run by several top universities, 
  focussing on areas such as energy systems, environment systems and design of smart cities. 
  I recently returned to Cambridge, where I will be based for the remainder of my PhD.
